## things to figure out ----------------------------------

* who does what?
    nikki - (implement objects, build the garden, press buttons) kanske
    Theo - modelling, interaction
    willy - 
* what language?
    three.js   - maybe (cannon.js & ammo.js & babylon)
    webxr
    javascript + html + css (maybe)

* how busy are people? what do you have besides this?
    Theo - ai till på fredag
    Nikki - små uppgifter tills på torsdag, nätverks LABB till JUL!!
    Willy - labb2, AI project till på fredag

* high intensive timeslots
    3-5 jan
    otherwise when you have time

* should we set up some sort of schedule?    - 10 jan - presentation

* who wants the vr goggles?
    nikki is the holder

* homework
    understand the current 3js code
    read up on 3js (checkout the video above)
    learn how to implement webxr

## Minimum implementation requirement (should) -----------------------------

* have a room
    have objects in the room (rocks, plants, tree?)
    implement textures and colours for 

* Light up the room
    implement shadows
    raytrace or rasterize?

* be able to move around the room

* THREE.interactive - 

* pick stuff up?  (vr implementation)
* rotate head to look around (vr implementation)
    read up on webxr

## things that might be nice to have (could) -------------------------------------


* physics, objects dropping down when you let them go 
    (check cannon.js & ammo.js & babylon, would it be difficult to implement?)
    
    collision detection
    jumping? 
    shooting things out of an object?

* a squirrel with a paintball gun
* Roger and Emin's heads 

* shoot a ray, (from hand or item) and change color or size of object


## ideas (just some brainstorm parts) -----------------------------------

* beam that inverts the depth buffer and thus shows the inside of an object. (maybe hide somethings inside?)

* corridor with a "mirror  by the end" if you look at it for too long create something behind the player.

* a giant in the sky looking at you (just as a cool thing)
